# Socket.io learning project

Simple chat application that follow the getStarted guide and go further with the homeworks.

## Homework
  Here are some ideas to improve the application:

  - Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
  - Add support for nicknames.
  - Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he/she presses enter.
  - Add “user is typing” functionality.
  - Show who’s online.
  - Add private messaging. (use '/w username message' to whisper someone)
  - Share your improvements!
